Based on all the information before 2023-07-09, let's first analyze the positive developments and potential concerns for AXP. Come up with 2-4 most important factors respectively and keep them concise. Most factors should be inferred from company related news. Then let's assume your prediction for next week (2023-07-09 to 2023-07-16) is up by 2-3%. Provide a summary analysis to support your prediction. The prediction result need to be inferred from your analysis at the end, and thus not appearing as a foundational factor of your analysis.","[Positive Developments]:
1. American Express Company will be increasing its dividend payment compared to last year, indicating confidence in its financial stability and profitability.
2. Despite the recent stock price decrease, there are two new sample breakout stocks for Week 27 with more than 10% short-term upside, which suggests the potential for a rebound.

[Potential Concerns]:
1. American Express has been downgraded by Piper Sandler due to concerns over its heavy reliance on loan sales for revenue and the pressure it faces from higher rates and wider credit spreads.
2. The shares of American Express have experienced losses, contributing to the overall decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

[Prediction & Analysis]:
Based on the positive developments, such as the increased dividend payment and the potential for short-term upside in breakout stocks, there is a reason to be optimistic about American Express. However, the concerns highlighted by Piper Sandler regarding loan sales and operating margins should be taken into consideration.

Taking into account the overall market sentiment and the uncertainties in the financial services sector, we predict a moderate increase in American Express' stock price for the upcoming week. The potential rebound from the recent price decrease, combined with the positive news surrounding the dividend increase, could contribute to a 2-3% gain in the stock price. However, investors should closely monitor any further developments in the loan sales and credit spreads, as they could potentially impact the company's financial performance in the future."

Based on all the information before 2023-08-13, let's first analyze the positive developments and potential concerns for AXP. Come up with 2-4 most important factors respectively and keep them concise. Most factors should be inferred from company related news. Then let's assume your prediction for next week (2023-08-13 to 2023-08-20) is down by 3-4%. Provide a summary analysis to support your prediction. The prediction result need to be inferred from your analysis at the end, and thus not appearing as a foundational factor of your analysis.","[Positive Developments]:
1. American Express posted higher revenue in the second quarter as consumers continued to spend on travel, entertainment, and restaurants.
2. American Express' latest earnings were solid, with double-digit growth in both the top and bottom line.

[Potential Concerns]:
1. American Express set aside nearly $1.2 billion to cover bad card debts, indicating potential defaults on payments.
2. American Express' stock price slipped as the company set aside more money for possible defaults, despite profit and revenue growth.

[Prediction & Analysis]:
Based on the positive developments, it seems that American Express is benefiting from increased consumer spending in areas like travel and entertainment. However, the potential concerns related to the company's reserve build and possible defaults suggest some underlying risks.

Considering the stock price decline in the previous weeks and the concerns surrounding potential defaults, it is reasonable to predict that the stock price of American Express may continue to face downward pressure in the upcoming week. Therefore, a predicted decrease of 3-4% seems plausible. This prediction is supported by the fact that the stock price of American Express has been declining gradually over the past few weeks and the concerns surrounding defaults may contribute to further downward movement."

1. American Express is expanding its product suite and investing in technology advancements to enhance its offerings and attract new customers.
2. The company is testing biometrics technology for online checkout, which could help prevent fraud and improve customer experience.

[Potential Concerns]:
1. The stock price experienced a slight decline during the previous week despite positive news, suggesting potential investor skepticism or market volatility.
2. The impact of rising interest rates on American Express and its business model, particularly in the Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) sector, remains uncertain.

[Prediction & Analysis]:
Based on the positive developments and potential concerns, it is predicted that American Express's stock price will experience a decrease of more than 5% in the upcoming week (2023-10-15 to 2023-10-22). 

The slight decline in the stock price during the previous week, despite positive news, indicates some hesitancy or caution among investors. Additionally, the potential impact of rising interest rates on American Express's business model could further contribute to a decline in the stock price. Market volatility and uncertainties surrounding the BNPL sector may also play a role in the predicted decrease.

Overall, while American Express continues to innovate and expand its product offerings, these factors suggest a potential downward movement in the stock price for the upcoming week. Investors may be adopting a more cautious approach, leading to a decline in the stock price."

1. American Express announced a partnership with Formula One, which is the company's first new sports sponsorship in over a decade. This partnership could potentially expand American Express's customer base and drive brand recognition.
2. American Express continues to be recognized by analysts as a solid investment option, with some experts recommending the stock as a buy due to its growth potential and ability to withstand inflationary price pressure.

[Potential Concerns]:
1. Analysts have expressed concerns about American Express's revenue potentially coming in below the consensus forecast in the upcoming third-quarter earnings report. This is attributed to tightening measures from the Federal Reserve and their impact on consumer spending.
