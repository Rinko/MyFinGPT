Holman explains how consumers are being discerning at this time, which is something Walmart CEO Doug McMillon noted on the company\u2019s earnings call. \u201cPeople are buying groceries, they\u2019re trading down,\u201d which is \u201cpart of this longer trend that we\u2019ve been seeing over the past year,\u201d Holman says. Walmart has \u201ca bigger leg up\u201d than Target, Holman says because it sells more groceries and has lower price points. Target also experienced boycotts in June over pride-themed displays at stores, which impacted the company\u2019s sales. As this summer saw consumers spending on goods for experiences such as\u00a0Barbie\u00a0and tours from superstars Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9, Holman notes that although \u201cpeople have been spending a lot on those experiences as expected...they\u2019re still leaving space in their budget to buy the groceries or buy some of the bigger items that we weren\u2019t expecting.\u201d \u201cIt still remains to be seen how long that can last,\u201d as people have a \u201cfinite amount of money,\u201d but that\u2019s \u201cone of these really interesting dynamics that\u2019s happened this summer,\u201d Holman says.""}, {""date"": ""20230818161803"", ""headline"": ""Big retail & Consumers: Is the American Dream too expensive?"", ""summary"": ""As retail earnings from the like of Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) provided clearer insights into the state of the U.S. consumer, housing markets continue on a tumultuous path amid inventory concerns and elevated mortgage rates.
