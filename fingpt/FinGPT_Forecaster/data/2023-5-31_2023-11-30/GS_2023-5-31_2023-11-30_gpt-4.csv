[Summary]: On Friday, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C) all reported quarterly results that topped analyst estimates. Whalen Global Advisors Chairman Richard Christopher Whalen tells Yahoo Finance Live there are two key takeaways from the reports. First, Whalen notes that the growth in the costs of deposits slowed down. Second, Whalen says that ""credit is basically flat...because frankly the consumer is still okay."" Whalen also discusses the impact of regulation, something JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned about in his company's earnings release, saying ""material regulatory changes would likely have real world consequences for markets and end users."" Whalen says that additional regulation will likely force some consolidation among smaller and mid-sized banks because ""some banks are going to be better at readjusting their balance sheet than others, and the ones that don't move quickly are going to get sold."" In the interview, Whalen also previews what investors can expect from Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) and how commercial real estate is a ""chopped salad"" for banks.

[Summary]: Goldman Sachs favours large-cap Indian stocks that have lagged the broader market recently for one of its bets ahead of the country's general elections next year, as the broader macro outlook warrants a conservative stance, it said on Thursday.  Besides large-cap laggards, the Wall Street brokerage prefers companies with stable growth and consumer stocks that are likely to reverse their underperformance as demand recovers, analysts led by Sunil Koul said in a note.

Goldman Sachs (GS) is set to report on Tuesday, October 17, while Morgan Stanley (MS), Tesla (TSLA), and Netflix (NFLX) will be reporting on Wednesday, October 18. Yahoo Finance spoke to experts across the industry to break down the top things to watch for this earnings season. Yahoo Finance Senior Business Reporter Ines Ferré is keeping an eye on big tech companies and what to expect from Tesla and Netflix Q3 reports. Ferré said, ""Look, the expectations are still high for these companies."" AutoBlog Editor-in-Chief Greg Migliore broke down the latest round of price cuts by Tesla and what that means with regard to company outlook. Migliore said, ""Lower prices cut into margins, which means third quarter earnings are probably going to be a little bit lighter, more pedestrian, than we've seen in recent years.""

I'm watching for Cybertruck production and delivery news ... Finally the Model 3 refresh that's out in certain markets, but it's not here in the U.S. just yet."" According to Oppenheimer Managing Director & Head of Internet Research Jason Helfstein, there are three key things to watch with regard to Netflix's Q3 results: net subscriber adds, average revenue per membership, and plans for ad-tier. Helfstein said, ""That's where the noise is in the numbers, ultimately that revenue per subscriber they call ARM."" RBC Capital Markets Analyst Gerard Cassidy broke down the recent bank earnings and why RBC is bullish on big banks. Cassidy explained, ""I think what you're going to hear from Goldman and others ... is that the inflows are still strong, but they're moving more into cash-like products that have lower margins."" Wall Street Journal Reporter Ben Eisen discussed the concerns of bank executives despite a strong start to earnings season. Eisen said, ""A lot of the bank executives are signaling that we're kind of at a crossroads at this point ... as we get further and further along into this era of higher interest rates that we've seen, we are seeing some of that slowdown come.""
