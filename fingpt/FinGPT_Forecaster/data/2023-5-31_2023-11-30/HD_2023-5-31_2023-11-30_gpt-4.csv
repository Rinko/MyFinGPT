[Headline]: Buy Nvidia and Meta, Sell Home Depot and Exxon: Strategist's stock trades
[Summary]: GraniteShares Founder and CEO Will Rhind sits down with Yahoo Finance Live to share his preferred stock trades: Buy tech stocks Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta, Sell retailer Home Depot (HD) and oil producer Exxon Mobil (XOM). Rhind referenced Nvidia as the ""poster for AI exposure"" in a note he wrote. Nvidia shares continue to reach all-time highs in 2023, rising 200% year-to-date. Meta is another tech stock investing in artificial intelligence. Rhind specifies that AI is ""real"" and that it's proving to not just be ""a short-term hype where people got in and in six months time have forgotten all about it."" U.S. home sales are stalling as housing prices climb higher, which is why Rhind wants to shy away from home improvement retailer Home Depot. New homes may be selling, but homeowners locked into mortgages are not spending as much on home repair as they were during the ""big reshuffle"" from pandemic spending trends. Lastly, Rhind finds there to be geopolitical and environmental concerns tied to how much higher energy company Exxon Mobil may climb. He compares it to the post-pandemic nature of tech stocks, which have a lot more room to decline as COVID-era market conditions begin to settle down.

[Headline]: Millennials a 'tailwind' for Home Depot & Lowe's: Strategist
[Summary]: Lowe's (LOW) second quarter adjusted earnings beat analyst estimates, but missed slightly on revenue. It follows results from Home Depot (HD) which narrowly beat estimates. What do these results show about the state of the housing market? Smead Capital Management CEO Cole Smead joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss. “Housing has been probably the most misunderstood part of the economy, looking back over the last 10 years,” Smead says. Smead notes that “tight supply… is causing housing to be strong,” which “no one thought we’d be where we’re at on housing.” What has impacted Home Depot and Lowe’s “is as interest rates have increased, you just marginally cause people to look less to a home equity line, to revamp their home, and do things of that nature,” Smead explains. But “the one tailwind” that these retailers have is millennials owning homes, as they are “a huge customer base to those retailers,” Smead says. Companies like Home Depot and Lowe’s “have really good secular trends in their favor,” Smead notes.

[Headline]: Lowe’s earnings: Expect more margin improvement, analyst says
[Summary]: Lowe’s (LOW) reported mixed results for its second quarter. TD Cowen Director Max Rakhlenko joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the company’s earnings. “Lowe’s had good numbers” and “overall, the company is doing a really nice job of executing in a very mixed to tough backdrop,” Rakhlenko says. Lowe’s “pro environment remains better than DIY and we are seeing pro continue to outperform,” Rakhlenko notes. “Lowe’s has done a really nice job with the pro business for the last several years. They’re really looking to take market share with the smaller pros, whereas” Home Depot (HD) is “really focused on those large and much more complex pros,” Rakhlenko explains. Lowe’s pro business “is doing well, but the size of the business today does remain much smaller than where Home Depot is,” Rakhlenko says.  Rakhlenko says for Lowe’s margins, “management has done a great job over the last handful of years, of really improving operations, both at the store level as well as HQ… but we still think that they have several years more to go.” “We are seeing an improvement in margins” and we think some of the company’s “initiatives that they’ve got going… are going to help margins in the back half of the year,” Rakhlenko says.
