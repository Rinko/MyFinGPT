[Prediction & Analysis]:
Considering the positive developments, such as strong financial performance and the partnership with Tunnel to Towers, American Express appears to be in a favorable position. These factors demonstrate the company's ability to generate growth and its commitment to important social causes.

However, the potential disruption from BNPL companies and the lack of available financial information present some concerns. American Express needs to stay competitive and adapt its offerings to evolving consumer preferences to mitigate the threat posed by BNPL services.

Based on the positive developments and assuming market sentiment remains optimistic, it is reasonable to predict that American Express's stock price will continue its upward trend in the upcoming week. However, the absence of financial data makes it challenging to quantify the potential upside accurately.
